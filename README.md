•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Writing robust programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable can be achieved by writing reusable programs. We showcased this with the Python CRUD module we used. With this, we were able to make calls to a simple program that was able to create, read, update, and delete entries in our database. Without this CRUD module, we would have to write a length call statement many times in our finished product. We could easily adapt the CRUD module to new types of data by changing just that module. This would save time in the long run by not having to update the final code multiple times. 

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I always approach problems methodically. In this assignment, I did the same by starting at one point to reach the next point. This eventually allowed me to achieve the required finished product and build a program that could mesh effortlessly. We started uploading a database to a Mongo database. From there, we tested and ensure that the database was all there and the data was clean. We then secured the database with credentials ensuring that users that needed access were granted access and it was secure from everyone else. From there, we created a CRUD module that allowed us to use calls in that module. This allowed us to interact with the database through just that module ensuring that the code stayed secure and wasn’t able to be accessed by unauthorized users. Finally, we created a dashboard that provided a UI for users to display data in an organized fashion. 

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists make computer applications. In this case, we created a program that allowed a company to display and sort data. This would help a company that deals with large amounts of data organize that data and make it available to customers.
